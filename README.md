# Matrix-Multiplication-in-C
This C program performs matrix multiplication by taking two matrices as input from the user. It validates whether multiplication is possible by checking if the number of columns in Matrix A equals the number of rows in Matrix B. If valid, it calculates and displays the resulting product matrix using nested loops and 2D arrays.
